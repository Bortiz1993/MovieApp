### Description
Welcome fellow Developers, this is where you will find information about this Movie Search app.
I apreciate any feedback and if anyone wants to contribute, that is fine as well. My goal is to eventually turn this into a streaming service.

Movie Search App
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/974dbc81-0352-4a1e-9884-7835fcf83157/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/strong-nasturtium-0246a0/deploys)

Search for almost any movie that you want to, click on the movie, get information about ratings, release dates, trivia, etc. Deployed with Netlify.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel
